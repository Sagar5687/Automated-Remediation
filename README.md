# Automated Remediation Expert System

This project implements a **rule-based expert system** for IT Operations.
It reads infrastructure events from a CSV file, applies remediation rules using **Experta / Experta3**, and outputs a simplified CSV containing only the recommended actions.

## 🚀 Features

* Rule-based inference engine (expert system)
* Uses service metrics (CPU, Disk, Errors, Latency, Traffic)
* Automatically chooses remediation actions
* Clean output CSV (only actions + reasons)
* Easy to modify or add new rules

## 📦 Requirements

### Recommended (works best):

* **Python 3.8 or 3.9**
* Install experta:

  ```bash
  pip install experta
  ```

### If using Python 3.10–3.12:

* Install experta3:

  ```bash
  pip install experta3
  ```

## 🧠 How It Works

* Each event becomes a **Fact**
* Experta rules check for conditions such as:

  * High CPU under high traffic → **Scale out**
  * Too many restarts → **Escalate to on-call**
  * High error rate → **Rollback deployment**
  * Disk almost full → **Clear logs**
* The **first matching rule** generates the remediation action

## 📤 Example Output

```text
event_id,service_name,status,recommended_action,reason,severity
12,auth-service,CRITICAL,SCALE_OUT,"High CPU under high traffic",HIGH
27,payment-api,OK,NO_ACTION,"Service healthy",INFO
```

## 🛠 Editing Rules

Rules are located inside `RemediationEngine` and follow this pattern:

```python
@Rule(EventFact(cpu_percent=MATCH.cpu), TEST(lambda cpu: cpu > 90))
def high_cpu(self):
    # define action here
```
